#Write a function called name_counts. name_counts will take
#as input a list of full names. Each name will be two words
#separated by a space, like "David Joyner".
#
#The function should return a dictionary. The keys to the
#dictionary will be the first names from the list, and the
#values should be the number of times that first name
#appeared.
#
#HINT: Use split() to split names into first and last.


#Add your function here!
def name_counts(myList):
    retDict = dict()
    for names in myList:
        firstName = names.split()
        firstName = firstName[0]
    
        if firstName not in retDict:
            retDict[firstName] = 0
        retDict[firstName] += 1
    return retDict


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print (although the order of the keys may vary):
#{'Shelba': 5, 'Maren': 1, 'Nicol': 1, 'David': 2, 'Brenton': 2}
