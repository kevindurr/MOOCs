#Write a function called average_file. average_file should
#have one parameter: a filename.
#
#The file should have an integer on each line. average_file
#should return the average of these integers. However, if
#any of the lines of the file are _not_ integers,
#average_file should return the string "Error reading file!"
#
#Remember, by default, every time you read a line from a
#file, it's interpreted as a string.


#Add your function here!
def average_file(fileName):
    myFile = open(fileName, "r")
    sums = 0
    nums= 0
    for line in myFile:
        try: 
            sums += int(line)
            nums += 1
        except:
            myFile.close()
            return "Error reading file!"
    myFile.close()
    return sums / nums


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: 5.0, then Error reading file!
#
#You can select valid_file.txt and invalid_file.txt from
#the dropdown in the top left to preview their contents.
